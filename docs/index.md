# Get Started üëã

Welcome to Open Archiver! This guide will help you get started with setting up and using the platform.

## What is Open Archiver? üõ°Ô∏è

**A secure, sovereign, and affordable open-source platform for email archiving and eDiscovery.**

Open Archiver provides a robust, self-hosted solution for archiving, storing, indexing, and searching emails from major platforms, including Google Workspace (Gmail), Microsoft 365, as well as generic IMAP-enabled email inboxes. Use Open Archiver to keep a permanent, tamper-proof record of your communication history, free from vendor lock-in.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Universal Ingestion**: Connect to Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, and standard IMAP servers to perform initial bulk imports and maintain continuous, real-time synchronization.
- **Secure & Efficient Storage**: Emails are stored in the standard `.eml` format. The system uses deduplication and compression to minimize storage costs. All data is encrypted at rest.
- **Pluggable Storage Backends**: Support both local filesystem storage and S3-compatible object storage (like AWS S3 or MinIO).
- **Powerful Search & eDiscovery**: A high-performance search engine indexes the full text of emails and attachments (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
- **Compliance & Retention**: Define granular retention policies to automatically manage the lifecycle of your data. Place legal holds on communications to prevent deletion during litigation (TBD).
- **Comprehensive Auditing**: An immutable audit trail logs all system activities, ensuring you have a clear record of who accessed what and when (TBD).
