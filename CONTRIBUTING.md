# Contributing to Open Archiver

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Open Archiver! It's people like you that make open source such a great community. We welcome any and all contributions.

## Where do I start?

Not sure where to start? You can:

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/LogicLabs-OU/OpenArchiver/issues). If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements
